Rubyk's Cube
==========

This is a model of a Rubik's cube, built on top of the
[Rubyks](https://rubygems.org/gems/rubyks) gem that I authored a while back.

This is the first big project I did in 2013 when I was first learning to
program. The css model for the cube was generated with
[tridiv](http://tridiv.com)
